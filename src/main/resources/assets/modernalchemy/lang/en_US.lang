modernalchemy.gui.teslaPower=§6Tesla Power§R
modernalchemy.gui.teslaPowerInfo=§6Tesla Power§R is the unit of power for Modern Alchemy. Each §6Tesla§R is equal to 10 §4Redstone Flux§R (RF). Most machines run off of §6Tesla Power§R so its important to get a good setup of §9Tesla Coils§R. §6Teslas§R are transmitted through bolts of lightning generated by the §9Tesla Coil§R. Be careful though, these can be dangerous! If you wish to walk in the lightning you can; simply equip a full set of §9Faraday Armor§R and you will be protected from those dangerous bolts.

tile.modernalchemy.blockTeslaCoil.name=Tesla Coil
tile.modernalchemy.blockTeslaCoil.description=The §9Tesla Coil§R is the main part of the Tesla Coil multi-block. You will need to place this on top of a §9Tesla Stand§R which in turn is placed on another §9Tesla Stand§R or §9Tesla Base§R. The coil will send §6Tesla Power§R to nearby machines. Don't get caught in between the coil and the machine without a full set of §9Faraday Armor§R!

tile.modernalchemy.blockTeslaStand.name=Tesla Coil Stand
tile.modernalchemy.blockTeslaStand.description=The §9Tesla stand§R is used to connect the §9Tesla Coil Base§R and the §9Tesla Coil§R. You can have as many of these in between the stand and the coil as you wish. Be warned, if you break this block the stands and coil above it will fall!

tile.modernalchemy.blockTeslaBase.name=Tesla Coil Base
tile.modernalchemy.blockTeslaBase.description=The §9Tesla Base§R is the base of the §9Tesla Coil§R multi-block. Place this down and power it with §4Redstone Flux§R energy (RF). The base will then convert the §4Redstone Flux§R energy into §6Tesla§R energy. This is the only block in the §9Tesla Coil§R multi-block that will accept power. Be warned, if you break this block the stands and coil above it will fall!

tile.modernalchemy.blockSuperTeslaCoil.name=Tesla Coil MKII
tile.modernalchemy.blockSuperTeslaCoil.description=The §9Tesla Coil MKII§R is exactly like the §9Tesla Coil§R with the added benefit of being 8x better. That means 8x conversion speed and 8x transmitted energy. Just place this coil on top of a stand just like you would a §9Tesla Coil§R.

tile.modernalchemy.blockOreActinium.name=Actinium Ore
tile.modernalchemy.blockOreActinium.description=§9Actinium Ore§R is the central resource for this mod. You will be melting this down and creating a medium to replicate items. It is recommended that you use a silk-touch pickaxe as it will double the yield per ore. Be warned, §9Actinium§R is radioactive and will poison you!

tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceCore.name=Arc Furnace Processor
tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceCore.description=The §9Arc Furnace Processor§R is the central controller of the Arc Furnace multi-block. To learn how to build the multi-block, see §9Arc Furnace Multi-Block§R in the "More Info" section of this book. The purpose of this block and its associated multi-block is to melt §9Actinium§R into §9Molten Actinium§R. This can be used in the §9Amalgamator§R to create the §9Replicator Mediums§R needed for replication.

tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummy.name=Arc Furnace Casing
tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummy.description=The §9Arc Furnace Casing§R is used to build the §9Arc Furnace Multi-Block§R. These can be placed anywhere in the structure (except where the energy receiver should be). On their own, the §9Arc Furnace Casings§R do not do much. The are used in crafting of the other more useful casings however.

tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummyItemIO.name=Arc Furnace Item I/O
tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummyItemIO.description=The §9Arc Furnace Item I/O§R is the interface used to import and export items into the §9Arc Furnace§R. You can open the GUI and place the items in manually, but that's no fun. The §9Arc Furnace Item I/O§R will automatically import smeltable materials and fuels from the inventory adjacent to it. Simply place a chest next to this port and it will handle filling its inventory with priority on higher output items first, i.e §9Actinium Ore§R will be selected before §9Actinium Dust§R as it has a higher output value. This block has §4Restricted Placement§R in the §9Arc Furnace Multi-Block§R.

tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummyAirValve.name=Arc Furnace Compressed Air Valve
tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummyAirValve.description=The §9Arc Furnace Compressed Air Valve§R allows you to import §9Compressed Air§R into the §9Arc Furnace§R. This is a key component in producing §9Molten Actinium§R and is a requirement for the §9Arc Furnace§R to run. This block will automatically try and pull from adjacent tanks.

tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummyOutputValve.name=Arc Furnace Output Valve
tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummyOutputValve.description=The §9Arc Furnace Output Valve§R is used to export §9Molten Actinium§R from the §9Arc Furnace§R. This block will automatically try and export to adjacent tanks/pipes. No need to use an extraction pipe.

tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummyEnergy.name=Arc Furnace Energy Receiver
tile.modernalchemy.blockArcFurnaceDummyEnergy.description=The §9Arc Furnace Energy Receiver§R is the antenna used to receive power into the §9Arc Furnace§R. Place this on top of the 3x3x3 structure to complete it and this block will draw power from near-by §9Tesla Coils§R to charge the §9Arc Furnace's§R energy tank. Be careful, having this exposed to the sky in a thunderstorm may attract lightning!

tile.modernalchemy.blockElectricBellows.name=Electric Bellows
tile.modernalchemy.blockElectricBellows.description=The §9Electric Bellows§R is responsible for compressing air into §9Compressed Air§R. This is used in the §9Arc Furnace§R to create §9Molten Actinium§R. You can configure this block to automatically export §9Compressed Air§R out each side using the GUI tabs.

tile.modernalchemy.blockAmalgamator.name=Amalgamator
tile.modernalchemy.blockAmalgamator.description=The §9Amalgamator§R is used to turn §9Molten Actinium§R into §9Replicator Mediums§R. This block has configurable auto-import and auto-export using the Gui tabs.

tile.modernalchemy.blockPatternRecorder.name=Pattern Recorder
tile.modernalchemy.blockPatternRecorder.description=The §9Pattern Recorder§R is used to produce the §9Patterns§R that are used in the §9Replicator§R to replicate items. The inventory takes an input item (left slot) and consumes it and processes it into a §9Pattern§R (center slot). Add another item to a §9Pattern§R that is already programed to increase its quality.

tile.modernalchemy.blockAdvancedCrafter.name=Advanced Crafter
tile.modernalchemy.blockAdvancedCrafter.description=The §9Advanced Crafter§R is the first machine you will need to make to begin progression into this mod. It is powered by §4Redstone Flux§R. The §9Advanced Crafter§R has 4 modes: §LEnriching, Extruding, Bending, and Furnace§R. The first three modes will try to make the most complex recipe first(it will check all 4 slots, then 3 etc). The §LFurnace Mode§R will smelt up to 4 at once if possible, functioning as a powered furnace.

item.modernalchemy.itemReplicatorPattern.name=Replicator Pattern
item.modernalchemy.itemReplicatorPattern.description=The §9Replicator Pattern§R is used to record the information used to replicate items. Use this in a §9Pattern Recorder§R to consume an item and store its information into this item. It will store the item's value and quantity output. This item also has a quality value, the lower it is the higher the chance replication will fail using this pattern. If you want to increase the quality, run it through the §9Pattern Recorder§R again with the same item to increase the quality.

item.modernalchemy.itemReplicationMedium.name=Replication Medium
item.modernalchemy.itemReplicationMedium.description=The §9Replication Medium§R is used in the §9Replicator§R along with a §9Recorded Pattern§R in order to replicate the item. To get §9Replicator Mediums§R, supply an §9Amalgamator§R with §9Molten Actinium§R and it will solidify it into §9Replicator Mediums§R.

item.modernalchemy.wrench.name=Wrench
item.modernalchemy.wrench.description=The §9Wrench§R is just like other wrenches. It will work with as most other wrenches from other mods and will rotate chests and such but you need to use this wrench (or most any wrench) in order to pick up this mod's machines without explosions. Never break a machine with a pickaxe.

item.modernalchemy.itemActiniumDust.name=Actinium Dust
item.modernalchemy.itemActiniumDust.description=The result of mining §9Actinium Ore§R, §9Actinium Dust§R is used in the §9Arc Furnace§R to create §9Molten Actinium§R. Be careful, holding this item will poison you as Actinium is radioactive.

item.modernalchemy.laserNode.name=Replicator Laser
item.modernalchemy.laserNode.description=The §9Replicator Laser§R is probably not going to exist for long so why bother writing a description
